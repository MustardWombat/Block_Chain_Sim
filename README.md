# Block_Chain_Sim
 
Welcome to my little encryption program. This program will encrypt and decrypt a string using a simple Caesar cipher.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 
'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1,
A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

The key for the Caesar cipher will be 3. This means that each letter in the plaintext will be shifted 3 places down the alphabet.

elements used in this program:
- References
- Loops
- Functions
- Switch statements
- String manipulation
- User input
- Error handling
- Constants
- Basic encryption and decryption
- Simple blockchain simulation

While the program is very simple, is demonstrates important lessons in basic C++ functionalities.
With this in mind, I plan to build a hybrid program in Block_Chain_Sim_2, allowing for a more complex system.
